   adding Address records, and a Module Config page option for entering
   IP allocation ranges.
 * BIND DNS Server : Added basic support for delegation-only zones.
 * BIND DNS Server : Created two new bind8-lib.pl functions for creating
   and deleting slave zones, for use by remote callers to avoid transferring
   large amounts of data via RPC calls.
 * BIND DNS Server : If the rndc command is installed but does not re-load
   a zone properly, the ndc command will be attempted as well if possible.
 * Cluster Software Packages : When displaying the details of a package,
   the version numbers from each of the hosts it is installed on is shown.

   functions to run any shutdown-time code for newly created actions.
 * Bootup and Shutdown : Added an access control option to allow only
   the starting and stopping of actions, but not editing.

   now be defined for different local IP addresses. This can be useful
   for sites doing SSL virtual hosting that want to share the same certificate
   between Apache and Webmin for the same address.
 * Protected Web Directories : Added the ability to manage groups too,
   and to specify which users and groups from the password file are allowed.
 * BSD Firewall : The firewall configuration can now be copied automatically
   to multiple hosts in a cluster, and will be applied on all hosts when
