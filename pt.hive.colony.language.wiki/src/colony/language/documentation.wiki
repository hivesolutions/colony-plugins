====== Colony Web MVC Framework ======

Colony does all it can to encourage well designed applications by providing all the necessary infrastructures to effortlessly separate application concerns. With the Plugin Framework, one can separate a large application into different plugins that are meaningful on their own, but when it comes to designing a plugin%%'%%s interior, the natural tendency may be to excessively intertwine the code at this level, especially when the plugin provides a graphical interface. To turn the design and implementation of these features into a straightforward process, one can use the Colony Web MVC plugin, which provides an MVC Framework.

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern used to isolate business logic from input and presentation, permitting independent development, testing and maintenance of each.

An example MVC workflow in Colony could work like the following:


Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern used to isolate business logic from input and presentation, permitting independent development, testing and maintenance of each.

An example MVC workflow in Colony could work like the following:

  * User clicks a button used to refresh data;
  * The widget fires a "click" event;
  * The widget%%'%%s event is caught by an event handler in the Controller;
  * The event handler calls the appropriate logic in the Controller;
  * The Controller calls the Remote Model to fetch data from the data source, providing a callback from the Controller to be invoked when the operation is finished;
  * The Controller callback is invoked with the data;
  * The Controller stores the data in the Local Model for later reference;
  * The Controller strips the data that will be shown in the graphical interface and sets it in the Presentation Model;
  * The Controller refreshes the View by looking for changed Presentation Model properties and updating the View accordingly.
