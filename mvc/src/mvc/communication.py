class MvcCommunicationHandler(object):
    """
    The mvc communication (handler) class.

    The concept of communication in the mvc context is expressed
    through long polling. Other systems may exist on top of the
    infra-structure using the modular approach.

    The connection name (abstract value) is a value that defined
    a domain for which messages are diffused (diffusion scope).

    A communication connection is a virtual connection created
    between peers through various http requests or any other proxy
    communication infra-structure. The communication connection may
    be identified by the connection name and the id of the connection,
    this value is considered the connection information.

    A communication element is a three element tuple for connection,
    request and (target) timestamp for timeout (maximum wait time).
    This communication element represents a request from the client
    and the (request) associated must be flushed or the else the
    client will remain waiting indefinitely.

    There are two types of queues in the communication sub-system, the
    message queue (for each connection) that contains the various messages
    pending to be sent for the connection and the connection queue (global
    wide) that contains the various connections with messages pending to
    be sent.
